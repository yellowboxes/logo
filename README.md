<h1> Purpose: </h1> to create a logo for Rhodium, one which has LEDs that respond to gesture movements 
The purpose of this repository is to track an document the process and progress of the project: Rhodium Logo.


<p> Bill of Materials: 
 - (1) Microcontroller
 - (1) LED strip
 - (1) Strip of older + Soldering station
 - (1) Foam Board
 - (1) Box Cutter </p>
Milestones:
                Electrical                                                                         Mechanical
1) get microcontroller to light up LEDs                                         1) Find the correct dimensions for the casing
2) get microcontroller to light up LEDs with a sensor                           2) Find the correct material for the casing
3) replace LEDs with neopixels and light them up with sensor                    3) Carve the casing to match the logo
4) reprogramm the neopixels to light up according to prefrence
